# behavioral_monitering_web_application
Behavioral biometric authentication system for online exams using keystroke dynamics. The system extracts dwell time, flight time, typing speed, and error metrics to build a behavioral profile during enrollment. Live exam typing is compared using cosine similarity to generate real-time identity confidence and detect impersonation attempts.
